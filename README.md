# noncharacter-regex [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/noncharacter-regex.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/noncharacter-regex)

> Regular expression for matching or stripping non-characters from a string.

## Install with [npm](npmjs.org)

```bash
npm i noncharacter-regex --save
```

var regex = require('noncharacter-regex');
regex.test('abc\uFFFExyz');
//=> 'true'

// strip non-characters
'abc\uFFFExyz'.replace(regex, '');
```

## What's this all about?

[non-characters][wiki] are useful, for example, when you're doing string transformations and you need to use temporary placeholders to avoid unintentional mutations. In those cases, **this regex would be used _before_ do your transformations** to ensure that any existing non-characters are removed before you do your replacements. 

**Does that happen!?**

It's unlikely, but from time to time the `U+FFFE` non-character may show up in strings since it has the reverse binary sequence of [byte-order marks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark).
